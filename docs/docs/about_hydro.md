# Welcome to Hydro

Hello, my name is Caio and I’m a computer science engineering student. I always liked to study computers and how they work as well as their functionalities and technologies.

So, I decided to start ‘making’ the protocols and technologies we use today, starting with a 8 bit computer, an operational system, programmable language and many more. So, I have created the Hydro family, with all these studies.

This repository is public to be a way to study computers and technologies, and show what I have learned. Don’t be surprised if the language changes a bit along with the projects, this can be caused by my own implementation of documenting things and structuring code and projects.
